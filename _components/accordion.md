### This is a sample 

<ul class="jekyllcodex_accordion"> 
<li>
	<input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
	<label for="accordion2">Multi-line Block</label>
	<div>
		<p>This is line 1</p>
		<p>This is line 2<br>
			This is line 3</p>
	</div>
</li>
</ul>

Why the second accordion didn't work?
Does that mean that I can't have more than 1 accordion in a single page?

Lastly, why can't I codify the accordion snippet? It will break the accordion. 

Sample below
```
<ul class="jekyllcodex_accordion"> 
<li>
<input type="checkbox" id="accordion2">
<label for="accordion2">Multi-line Block</label>
<div>
<p>This is line 1</p>
<p>This is line 2<br>
This is line 3</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
```
